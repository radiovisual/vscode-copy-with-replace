## Keyboard Shortcuts

The "copy-with-replace" extension provides a single command to replace your specified strings in the currently-selected text before copying the selected text to the clipboard.

- **For use on Windows & Linux**: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
- **For use on macOS**: <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

### Copy the entire source code file

To run `Copy with Replace` on the entire source code file, simply Select the entire contents of the file, and then run copy your text with the right Keyboard shortcut for your operating system (see [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) above).

### Copy only selected text

If you only want to run "Copy with Replace" on selected text, be sure to have pre-selected the relevant text before you run the right Keyboard shortcut for your operating system (see [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) above).

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

`copyWithReplace.replacements`: An array of objects containing search and replace properties for string replacements. For example:

```json
{
  "copyWithReplace.replacements": [
    {
      "search": "foo",
      "replace": "bar"
    }
  ]
}
```

The example above would copy all the instances of `foo` with `bar` before moving the copied contents into the system clipboard.
